# Bank AI Chatbot Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for a specialized bank AI chatbot that learns exclusively from user-provided information. The chatbot will answer customer inquiries about bank statements, credit information, loan eligibility, and credit improvement strategies based solely on the information it has been trained on.

## System Components

### 1. Knowledge Base
- **Document Storage**: A structured repository for storing all user-provided documents
- **Information Extraction**: Process to extract relevant information from documents
- **Vector Database**: For storing document embeddings to enable semantic search
- **Knowledge Index**: An organized index of extracted information for quick retrieval

### 2. Natural Language Processing Engine
- **Query Understanding**: Identifies the intent and entities in user queries
- **Context Management**: Maintains conversation context for multi-turn interactions
- **Response Generation**: Creates human-like responses based on retrieved information

### 3. Retrieval System
- **Semantic Search**: Finds relevant information based on meaning rather than keywords
- **Relevance Ranking**: Prioritizes information based on relevance to the query
- **Source Attribution**: Tracks which document provided each piece of information

### 4. User Interface
- **Chat Interface**: Simple text-based interface for user interactions
- **Admin Interface**: For uploading documents and managing the knowledge base

## Data Flow

1. **Document Ingestion**:
   - User uploads documents to the knowledge base
   - System processes documents, extracts information, and creates embeddings
   - Information is indexed for retrieval

2. **Query Processing**:
   - User submits a query through the chat interface
   - System analyzes the query to determine intent and extract entities
   - System retrieves relevant information from the knowledge base
   - System generates a response based on retrieved information
   - Response is presented to the user

3. **Feedback Loop**:
   - System logs interactions for future improvements
   - Admin can update knowledge base with new documents

## Technical Implementation

### Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Flask**: Web framework for the application
- **NLTK/spaCy**: For natural language processing
- **Sentence-Transformers**: For creating document embeddings
- **FAISS**: For efficient similarity search
- **SQLite**: For storing structured data

```

## Security and Privacy Considerations

- **Information Isolation**: The chatbot will only access and use information from the provided documents
- **No External API Calls**: The system will not make external API calls to fetch information
- **Data Protection**: All sensitive information will be properly handled and protected
- **Response Validation**: Responses will be validated to ensure they only contain information from the knowledge base

## Limitations

- The chatbot can only answer questions based on information in the provided documents
- Complex reasoning beyond the scope of provided information will be limited
- The system will acknowledge when it doesn't have sufficient information to answer a query

## Future Enhancements

- Improved document processing for more complex document types
- Enhanced context management for more natural conversations
- Integration with bank systems for real-time data access (if desired)
- Multi-language support
