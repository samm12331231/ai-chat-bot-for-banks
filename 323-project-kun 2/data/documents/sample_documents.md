- **Very Good**: 740-799
- **Good**: 670-739
- **Fair**: 580-669
- **Poor**: 300-579

### Factors Affecting Your Credit Score

4. **Credit Mix (10%)**: Types of credit accounts (revolving, installment)
5. **New Credit (10%)**: Recently opened accounts and credit inquiries

## Strategies to Improve Your Credit Score

### Short-Term Strategies (1-3 months)

#### 1. Check Your Credit Reports
- Request free reports from all three bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion)
- Identify and dispute errors or inaccuracies
- Look for accounts you don't recognize (potential identity theft)

#### 2. Reduce Credit Utilization
- Pay down credit card balances
- Aim for utilization below 30% (ideally below 10%)
- Request credit limit increases (without hard inquiries if possible)
- Keep accounts open even after paying them off

#### 3. Set Up Payment Reminders
- Enroll in automatic payments
- Set calendar alerts for due dates
- Consider paying multiple times per month

### Medium-Term Strategies (3-12 months)

#### 1. Establish a Positive Payment History
- Make all payments on time
- Catch up on past-due accounts
- Consider setting up a payment plan for collections

#### 2. Become an Authorized User
- Ask a family member with good credit to add you as an authorized user
- Ensure the account has a positive payment history and low utilization
- Verify that the card issuer reports authorized users to credit bureaus

#### 3. Apply for a Secured Credit Card
- Start with a small deposit ($200-$500)
- Use the card for small purchases (10-20% of limit)
- Pay the balance in full each month
- After 6-12 months of responsible use, request an upgrade to an unsecured card

### Long-Term Strategies (1+ years)

#### 1. Diversify Your Credit Mix
- Maintain a mix of revolving credit (credit cards) and installment loans
- Consider a credit-builder loan from a credit union
- Only apply for new credit when necessary

#### 2. Limit Hard Inquiries
- Research loan terms before applying
- Shop for rates within a focused period (14-45 days)
- Avoid applying for multiple credit cards in a short timeframe

#### 3. Be Patient with Negative Information
- Late payments: Stay on report for 7 years
- Chapter 13 bankruptcy: Stays on report for 7 years
- Chapter 7 bankruptcy: Stays on report for 10 years
- The impact of negative items diminishes over time

## Dealing with Debt

### Debt Reduction Strategies

#### 1. Debt Avalanche Method
- List all debts from highest to lowest interest rate
- Make minimum payments on all debts
- Put extra money toward the highest-interest debt
- Once highest-interest debt is paid, move to the next highest

#### 2. Debt Snowball Method
- List all debts from smallest to largest balance
- Make minimum payments on all debts
- Put extra money toward the smallest debt
- Once smallest debt is paid, move to the next smallest
- Provides psychological wins to maintain motivation

#### 3. Debt Consolidation
- Combine multiple debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate
- Options include personal loans, balance transfer cards, home equity loans
- Consider fees and terms carefully before consolidating

### Handling Collections

#### 1. Validate the Debt
- Request written verification of the debt
- Verify the collection agency's right to collect
- Check if the debt is within the statute of limitations

#### 2. Negotiation Strategies
- Offer a lump-sum settlement (typically 30-50% of the balance)
- Get any settlement agreement in writing before making payment
- Request "pay for delete" (removal of collection from credit report)
- If unsuccessful, at least request "paid in full" status
