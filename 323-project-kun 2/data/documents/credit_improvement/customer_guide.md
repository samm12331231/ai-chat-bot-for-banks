## Understanding Your Credit Score

### What is a Credit Score?
A credit score is a numerical expression based on your credit history that represents your creditworthiness. In the UAE, the Al Etihad Credit Bureau (AECB) maintains credit scores ranging from 300 to 900, with higher scores indicating better creditworthiness.

### How to Check Your Credit Score

   - Register for an account using your Emirates ID

   - Download your credit report and score

2. **Through Emirates NBD**
   - Some banking packages include free credit score checks
   - Ask your relationship manager for assistance

### What Your Credit Score Means
- **800-900**: Excellent - Very low risk, high approval chances for credit
- **700-799**: Good - Low risk, good approval chances
- **600-699**: Fair - Moderate risk, may qualify for standard rates
- **500-599**: Poor - High risk, may face higher interest rates
- **300-499**: Very Poor - Very high risk, difficult to obtain credit

### Factors Affecting Your Credit Score
1. Payment history (35%)
